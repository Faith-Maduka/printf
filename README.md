# printf
---
***This is our first team project at ALX. My wonderful partner, `Faith Maduka` and I worked on this together.<br>
I must say it was tedious at first, but when the design was planned, it became fairly easier for us. During this<br>
period, we realised that those who implemented `printf` function did a wonderful job.***

### Syntax:
